Operations for Editing:
1. Insert
2. Delete
3. Substitution

Edit Distance Algorithm:
1. If the input string is empty, insert all characters of the target string into it.
2. If the target string is empty, delete all characters of the input string.
3. If the last character of both strings is equal, ignore them and recursively run the function till before the last character.
4. If the last characters are unequal, consider all three operations on the last character of the first string, recursively compute the minimum cost for all three operations, and take a minimum of three values.

Program Procedure:
1. Create a Dataframe of words.
2. Take user input of word.
3. Using a loop calculate the edit distances of each word in the dataframe from the user input string and store it in a new column.
4. Find minimum edit distance using the min() function.
5. Make a list of all words having an edit distance equal to the minimum edit distance.
6. Provide suggestions for auto-correct.
